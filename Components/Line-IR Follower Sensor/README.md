## Line/IR Follower Sensor
Line follower sensors detect the presence of a black line by emitting infrared (IR) light and detecting the light levels that return to the sensor. They do this using two components: 
- An emitter
- A light sensor (receiver)

## How to use a line sensor
You know a bit more how a line follower sensor works, now you should learn how to use it. 

- VCC needs to be connected to a voltage in between 3.3 and 5V, to power the device
- GND is the ground pin that is required to complete the circuit
- AO is the analogue output 
- DO is the digital output pin
