## RoverBot
RoverBot is a REX robot that allows you to move comfortably in difficult terrain conditions thanks to its crawler structure. With RoverBot, you can perform tasks that require rough, difficult terrain. Like other REX 8 in 1 robots, you can control the RoverBot remotely if you want, or you can move it autonomously with the code you wrote in it.
