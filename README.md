REX is an educational robot kit developed by Robotistan R&D team. 8 in 1 robot kit, with its motherboard using the ESP32 infrastructure, eliminates the difficulties encountered in circuit setup such as port connection point and cable confusion
Nonetheless, Arduino IDE, Thonny IDE and MicroBlocks IDE provide the user with great flexibility in programming.

The REX card is a special card designed to make the mechanical and electronic installations of the robots in the 8 in 1 kit more convenient. On this card, which uses the ESP32E processor, there are connectors to easily connect all the components used in the REX 8 in 1 set to the circuit with a single cable.

There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card, 4 motor drivers and servo motor connectors for making the installation of 8 in 1 robots and circuit designs easier on the REX card, 1 connection connector for each of the HC-SR04, TCRT5000 and MPU6050 sensors, a 7V-12V battery for external circuit There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card.
