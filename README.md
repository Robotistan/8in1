The REX card is a special card designed to make the mechanical and electronic installations of the robots in the 8 in 1 kit more convenient. On this card, which uses the ESP32E processor, there are connectors to easily connect all the components used in the REX 8 in 1 set to the circuit with a single cable.

There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card, 4 motor drivers and servo motor connectors for making the installation of 8 in 1 robots and circuit designs easier on the REX card, 1 connection connector for each of the HC-SR04, TCRT5000 and MPU6050 sensors, a 7V-12V battery for external circuit There is a port for connecting and 1 buzzer and switch integrated into the card.
